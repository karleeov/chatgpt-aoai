Reason 1:
Your Clerk instance keys are incorrect, or you recently changed keys (Publishable Key, Secret Key).
How to resolve:
-> Make sure you're using the correct keys from the Clerk Dashboard. If you changed keys recently, make sure to clear your browser application data and cookies.

Reason 2:
A bug that may have already been fixed in the latest version of Clerk NextJS package.
How to resolve:
-> Make sure you are using the latest version of '@clerk/nextjs' and 'next'.
